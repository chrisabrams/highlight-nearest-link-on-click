#Vacation Time
An app where you choose where you want to go on vacation!

##Usage
Click on a country link. The info on the right will tell you how many times you hit a link vs. missed a link.

Links will be highlighted regardless if you actually click on a link. If you don't click on the link, the closest link relative to the click will be highlighted.

##F.A.Q.
Clicking in the sidebar on the right is not going to trigger the anchor tags, as the sidebar is designed as a visual aid and I didn't want to get all recursive..

##Running
Open the index.html file to see the project.

If you have node you can also use serve:

	serve

##Building
From the project's root run:

	npm install
	./build
